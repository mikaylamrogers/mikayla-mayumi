                Initially established as a renowned organic hair salon in Hawaii, Lisa Megumi had a vision to expand her business and create a global presence through an e-commerce platform. Lisa aimed to provide her loyal clientele with a seamless online shopping experience while preserving the personal touch she had developed with them over the years.
                <br><br>
                My objective was to develop a comprehensive branding strategy that seamlessly translated the natural and invigorating ambiance of Lisa's physical salon to the digital realm of the web. In addition, I undertook the task of building a visually captivating and user-friendly website that not only resonates with visitors but also significantly boosts sales.
                <br><br>
                The website showcases the authenticity of Lisa's organic products while maintaining her strong connection to environmentally conscious values.
