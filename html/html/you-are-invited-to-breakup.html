                My project touches on my personal experience living between analog and digital technologies, growing up in the early 2000s. 
                <br><br>
                To make my experience interactive and to present an open invitation for others to comment, relate, and react, I am referring to Smart Design’s design research tool, <a href="https://vimeo.com/11854531" target=_blank style="text-decoration: underline">The Breakup Letter.</a> They created this tool to understand the emotional connection between people and their products, services, and experiences. 
                <br><br>
                Today, we live in a booming digital age where the replacement cycle length of consumer smartphones is falling to 2 years. By 2030, the number of smart devices collecting, analyzing, and sharing data should hit 50 billion. 
                <br><br>
                In other words, we live in a constant breakup and makeup world. In my project, I warmly invite users to write a breakup letter to a correspondent of their choice.
