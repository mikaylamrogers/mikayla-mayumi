        <h3 style="font-style: italic; color: #E69138; font-weight: bold;">“How might we make learning technology more fun and efficient for older adults with low-mid tech literacy?”</h3>

        <p>Introducing IRIS, a program aimed at increasing the tech literacy of the older generation and empowering the younger generation to be community leaders. IRIS was designed by Chris Glenn, Jessica Chen, Sarah Koh, Xinran Shen, and myself as a result of our shared experience of getting that call from an older adult in our lives asking for help with their tech device. 
            <br><br>
            IRIS operates in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/site/dfta/index.page" target=_blank style="text-decoration: underline;">NYC Department for the Aging</a> as well as the <a href="https://www.nypl.org/space-rental" target=_blank style="text-decoration: underline;">New York Public Library.</a> Programming takes the form of 3 service options for older adults to attend: 
            <ul>
                <li>1. Workshops</li>
                <li>2. Walk-ins</li>
                <li>3. Scheduled 1-1 Appointments</li>
            </ul>
    
            At each of these services, older adults will have the opportunity to increase their tech literacy by learning from a high school volunteer. Volunteers are highly experienced with tech and trained to teach patiently using the <a href="https://www.evidencebasedteaching.org.au/the-i-do-we-do-you-do-model-explained/" target=_blank style="text-decoration: underline;">I-We-You Approach. </a>

        <!-- PART 1 -->
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Part 1: Exploration</h3>
        <p>We began our research process by narrowing down our problem statement:</p>
        <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">The digital divide is getting bigger, and as a result, older generations are falling behind on using the latest technology. How can we make an easier and more accessible system for them?</p>
        <p>When we researched current existing solutions in NYC, we found that they touch on many important features, yet they fail to include them all:</p>
        <img class="iris" src="../iris/competition.png" width="100%">

        <div class="container">
            <img class="iris" src="../iris/interview.png" width="100%">
            <p>From here, we began conducting interviews with our own parents or grandparents. Personally, I interviewed my grandmother to gauge her habits and issues while using her devices. Through this interview, however, I learned that though she experiences many tech-related problems, it is actually also difficult for her to explain what the issues are. As a result, I decided to also interview my mom and younger brother, who are her primary go-to sources for help.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- PART 2 -->
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Part 2: Synthesis</h3>
        <p>After everyone in my group had conducted interviews, we came together to organize our findings and highlight our insights. We organized our findings into 3 categories: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Current Tech Help Solutions, Habits/Most-Used Functions,</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Common Problems & Obstacles.</span></p>
        <img class="iris" src="../iris/findings.png" width="100%">
        <p>We also narrowed down our two primary user personas: <span style="font-weight: bold;">the older adult encountering tech-related issues,</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">a high school student looking for volunteer opportunities.</span></p>
        
        <div class="container">
            <img class="iris" src="../iris/persona1.png" width="100%">
            <img class="iris" src="../iris/persona2.png" width="100%">
        </div>

        <p>Finally, we landed on our HMW Statement: <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">“How might we make learning technology more fun and efficient for older adults with low-mid tech literacy?”</span></p>

        <!-- PART 3 -->
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Part 3: Pre-Prototyping</h3>
        <p>To begin prototyping, we began with a timed idea generation session. In the end, we found that most of our ideas were either touching on a physical manual, smart tech plugins, or a community-based service.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <img class="iris" src="../iris/proto1.png" width="100%">
            <img class="iris" src="../iris/proto2.png" width="100%">
        </div>

        <p>After circling back to the goals of our How Might We—redesigning the learning process for older adults, rather than fixing every tech problem—we landed on an idea that encompasses both the tangibility of learning as well as the aspect of community. To draw out our service plan, we fleshed out this prototype map:</p>
        <img class="iris" src="../iris/protomap.png" width="100%">

        <p>We also fleshed out what our future journey map would look like:</p>

        <!-- PART 4 -->
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Part 4: Prototypes</h3>
        <p>Our first MVP and prototype was our My Tech Guide—a booklet for tech helpers to fill out instructions for older adult learners: </p>
        
        <div class="container">
            <img class="iris" src="../iris/prototest.png" width="100%">
            <p>After testing our My Tech Guide prototype with 2 sets of helpers + learners, however, we found that:<br><br>
                    · Purely text instructions were not easy to follow for the learner<br>
                    · Addition of screenshots and visual elements proved to be extremely helpful<br>
                    · For the helper, they were not sure how in-depth to write instructions<br>
                    · Helpers asked us what wording would be helpful<br>
        </div>
            
            As a result, we reconfigured the My Tech Guide into a binder  for our students to take home notes, so that they would be able to remember the solutions they have learned. We also decided to create our Knowledgebase, a system for helpers to refer to or add existing solutions:    </p>
        
        <div class="container">
            <img class="iris" src="../iris/knowledgebase.png" width="100%">
            <img class="iris" src="../iris/binder.png" width="100%">
        </div>

        <!-- PART 5 -->
        <h3 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Part 5: The Result</h3>
        <p>IRIS' fun, friendly, and accessible marketing materials were designed with our HMW Statement in mind.  </p>

        <div class="container">
            <img class="iris" src="../iris/marketing.png" width="100%">
            <img class="iris" src="../iris/video.png" width="100%">
        </div>

        <p>Whether an older adult encounters our ad on the subway, or a high schooler stumbles upon our TikTok video, we want to emphasize our 3 key service gains:</p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Mutually beneficial for teachers & learners</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>·  Equips high school volunteers with skills & tangible experience for their future</li>
                    <li>·  Helps older learners to gain confidence with their devices & broader knowledge of technology</li>
                </ul>
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Equal opportunity</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>·  This program is free for learners, making this program accessible to people from a diverse range of income groups</li>
                </ul>
            
                <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Building intergenerational community bonds</span>
                <ul>
                    <li>· By bringing together 2 generations, we are able to build closer communities within New York City</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
