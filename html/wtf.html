    <h1>WTF (What the Font)</h1>

    <p>
        For our course Multimodal Interface Design, my group designed the interface of WTF: an app for users to find the name of a font by scanning an image/screenshot of text with their device's camera. The app provides three possible font results at a time, and the user can continually refresh the results until they find a font name that they deem correct. Once a font name is matched, it is stored in the user's library, which they can then organize by keyword tags.
