        Coded a design system in p5.js focused on the result of the Philippines' 2022 election result. The coded design is printed on the risograph. This project is based on a satirical perspective, likening Bong Bong Marcos to that of a bong.

        On June 30th, 2022, the Philippines’ seventeenth president rose to power: Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. 36 years ago, the People Power revolution drove out the country’s tyrannical dictator of martial law: Ferdinand Marcos Sr. His downfall finally triggered when “opposition leader Benigno Aquino had been in exile in the United States after fleeing the Marcos regime. Determined to bring democracy to his country, he flew back to the capital Manila – but was shot dead after landing.” (BBC) Marcos won the presidency again as a result of massive electoral fraud, which sparked the 4 days of unrest of the People’s Power Revolution. He and his family fled to Hawaii in exile, where he died 3 years later in 1989.
        Years after his death, his infamous wife Imelda Marcos has continued in her attempt to revive his legacy. This year, her plan for returning to power finally came into fruition, with her son Bongbong Marcos winning the presidency, putting the Marcos regime back on the throne.
